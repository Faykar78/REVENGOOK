## 📡 Transmission Incoming...

**Revengook** is a minimalistic, cyberpunk-inspired ephemeral data store. It serves as a secure digital drop-dead box for quick information sharing. No logins. No tracking. Just pure data transmission.

### ⚡ Core Capabilities

*   **🔒 Zero-Knowledge Storage**: Your data is yours. We don't read it.
*   **⏳ 24-Hour Self-Destruct**: All data remains in the vault for exactly 86,400 seconds before being permanently purged from existence.
*   **🔗 Secure Uplinks**: Generate unique, sharable access points (e.g., `/#SECRET_CODE`) to instantly transmit data to allies.
*   **📱 Mobile-Ready Interface**: Fully optimized terminal interface for field operations on any device.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Core**: Node.js & Express
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon.tech)
*   **Deployment**: Render Web Services
*   **Frontend**: Vanilla JS (Cyberpunk UI)

## 🚀 Deployment

1.  **Clone the Repository**
2.  **Set Environment Variables**:
    *   `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string.
3.  **Run Protocol**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> *This tool is designed for secure, temporary data transfer. The creators (THE REVENGERS) assume no liability for the critical nature of data lost after the 24-hour purge cycle.*
